```

## 🛠 Prerequisites
To compile and run the programs, ensure you have a C compiler installed. Common options include:
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Clang
- Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler

### Installation (GCC)
For Linux/macOS:
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gcc  # Debian-based systems
sudo yum install gcc  # RHEL-based systems
```

For Windows:
- Install [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) and add it to the system path.

## 🚀 Compilation & Execution
To compile a C program:
```sh
gcc filename.c -o output_name
```
To run the executable:
```sh
./output_name  # Linux/macOS
output_name.exe  # Windows
```

## 📌 Topics Covered
✅ Basic Syntax & Operators  
✅ Control Flow (Loops, Conditions)  
✅ Functions & Recursion  
✅ Pointers & Memory Management  
✅ File Handling  
✅ Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)  
✅ Algorithms (Sorting, Searching)  
✅ System Programming (Process & Thread Management)
